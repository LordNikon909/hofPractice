# HOF Practice

Learning about higher order functions, but not quite sure how they work yet? This practice repo contains a suite of very simple exercises, so you can focus on the syntax of passing arguments and invoking higher order functions properly, without getting bogged down in the logic of a more complex toy problem.

This repo was created as curriculum for Hack Reactor Precourse, but anyone who finds it useful may utilize it.
